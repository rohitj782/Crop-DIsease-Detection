PROJECT COLAB LINK -> https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qTRrE4pFduqgWMzbS52Mrxauw29MCezz#scrollTo=NKoPgmAC8kFc




# <b>Description -></b> 

Built an application to detect diseases in crops by scanning their leaves.

Tensorflow keras and Convolutional neural network is used to develop and built the model for this project.

Architecture of CNN is designed and developed from scratch,architecture is motivated from VGG 16.

Model trained for 100 epocs with training time of 5-6 hr.
